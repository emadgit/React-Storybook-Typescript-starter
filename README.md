I wanted to use storybook for one of my projects, and since I love typescript I had to add typescript support. Thanks to create-react-app they already add typescript support, but storybook needed some additional configuration. With this starter, you can enjoy making react component with storybook with typescript taste.

# How to use

Clone the repo and run `yarn` in root folder of project to install the dependencies.

To run the storybook :

### `yarn storybook`

To run the react app : 

### `yarn start`

To run tests : 

### `yarn test`
